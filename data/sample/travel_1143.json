{"accepted": 1, "answer": "Playa del Carmen has a great location about mid way between Cancun and Tulum both big tourist destination. Though it can hold it's own... We were there for a wedding recently and can't wait to go back. Here's a list of things we enjoyed and highly recommend The Beach at Playa Del Carmen one of the best and not as crowded or commercial as those in Cancun and Tulum. li Tulum The beach the ruins if you are into the Mayan Aztec culture The Mezzanine restaurant has THE most spectacular views you will ever see. li The Coba ruins not sure I'd go there again a long drive and Tulum and Chichen have more historic sites li Chichen Itza ruins An even longer drive but worth it if it's the only site you will see. li Diving into one of the many Cenotes if you enjoy snorkeling li If you have young travelers they'll love the dolphin adventures li ol With regards to safety a lot has been made out about the drug wars. We found it extremely safe with no issues. Just exercise common sense don't venture out needlessly after hours. Eat hot food from established restaurants. If you plan on shopping at the city make sure you are well aware of the exchange rate. We bought some art pieces which we negotiated in US only to be charged in Pesos. Needless to say on coming back we realized the exchange rate was ridiculous.

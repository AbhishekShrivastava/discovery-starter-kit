The train leaves Bishkek at 6.40am and takes around 4 hours. This is slower than minibuses or shared taxis which I took from Bishkek TO the lake but it's meant to be a really nice train trip and I'd like to take it back on Sunday. However not being in Balykchy myself I can't find the timetable for the return train aside from 'in the afternoon' which I'm assuming because we passed a train going in the other direction while in the minibus today . If someone can find the timetable I'd be highly appreciative ", "tags": "<trains><kyrgyzstan><bishkek>", "title": "What time is the daily train from Balykchy on Lake Issyk Kul to Bishkek?", "upModVotes": 4, "userId": "19", "userReputation": 17190, "username": "VMAtm", "views": 977}

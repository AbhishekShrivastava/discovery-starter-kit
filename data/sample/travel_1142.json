{"accepted": 1, "answer": "I've been living in Europe now for about 5 years but still make the bulk of my income from the US where I'm from . I have tried many US banks and all the debit cards you can imagine. Most promises of low transaction fees and hassle free transactions are lies. Here's what I've learned. Bank of America BofA strong I used BofA for all my ATM transactions for 2 years. They have an arrangement with the 8 biggest banks in the world Global ATM Alliance a Barclays UK BNP France Deutsche Bank Germany etc. If you use any one of their alliance ATMs they will in theory em not charge an ATM fee. However this is not always true. Some alliance members have ATMs in external zones for example Deustche Bank has ATMs outside of Germany in both Poland and Czech Republic etc. They will not charge you in Germany but you may face charges at these external ATMs. Loopholes not withstanding finding these specific ATMs can be an adventure one that more often than not ends in tears. BofA also charges high exchange rate fees. Capital One strong They used to have free transaction fees for foreign purchases one of the few but no longer they now charge 1 which is still low I believe the average is 2 3 . Never assume your card has low transactions or believe a word you read until you try it. Citibank strong Looked great on paper but wasn't. Do not use Citibank for travel outside the US. I tried using them thinking that because Citibank has branches all over europe it would be a good way to transfer money and use ATMs locally but it was not. It was worse then BofA much much worse. AVOID. Charles Schwab strong This is the card I've been using for the last 3 years and it is awesome. I've never thought it possible to like a bank but this one has never misled me yet em . Other cards may advertise ATM reimbursement this one actually does it. The others either have limits say limit 2 per month schemes requiring you to pull over a certain amount have 25 000 at all times or some other ridiculous crap hidden in fine print that the accountants at Arthur Anderson would have admired. This card has no weird restrictions you simply use it. I didn't believe it when I signed up but have had a perfect experience for 3 years. On the off chance they miss an ATM fee it happens 1 of the time you send them an email they remove it. Too good to be true? You would think so. Too good to last? Probably.

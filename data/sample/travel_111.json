{"answer": "So far as I'm aware it isn't currently possible. You can hire guides individually though. I've heard from a couple of different people that permits to Tibet for foreigners are currently closed though so you'd probably do just as well to call an agency the big places all have English speaking staff as well and see what the say. It's hard to find concrete information on these kinds of things but the agencies are usually more up to date. Hope that helps. Good luck with your travels.

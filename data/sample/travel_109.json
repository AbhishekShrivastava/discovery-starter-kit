You can also travel by train http www.amtrak.com a li ul In general bus routes cover more of the country than by train.

Buses are fairly cheap but pretty uncomfortable depends on your comfort level . If you're a good driver and over 25 you might consider renting a car.

Sometimes you can get special deals on rental cars for very cheap when the company has a high number of cars it needs returned to a particular city.

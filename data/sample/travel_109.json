{"answer": "There exist several bus lines http www.greyhound.com http megabus.com https www.boltbus.com and probably more that I can't think of right now. You can also travel by train http www.amtrak.com In general bus routes cover more of the country than by train. You can see a map of the Amtrak network here http www.mapmash.in amtrak.html Long distance trains are generally more comfortable than long distance buses. Long distance trains that include overnight trips usually have sleeping cars with beds.

Buses are fairly cheap but pretty uncomfortable depends on your comfort level . If you're a good driver and over 25 you might consider renting a car.

Sometimes you can get special deals on rental cars for very cheap when the company has a high number of cars it needs returned to a particular city.

{"accepted": 1, "answer": "Final answer Basically almost no pharmacy in Tajikistan knows of Warfarin Coumadin or other variants. This includes the pharmacies at the CARDIOLOGY hospital in Dushanbe. However on the grounds of said hospital is the English speaking Prospekt Medical Center based from London . They get requests for warfarin on average every 4 or so years and as such have a small supply of warfarin tablets and heparin injections. As far as the doctor on duty is aware and from my investigations this is probably the only location for warfarin in all of Tajikistan.

However am in Khorog Tajikistan and there's NONE in town and the pharmacist at the hospital believes there to be none in the country save for the 5 tablets in my bag. My question is what would be the nearest city from Dushanbe that I can get a visa on arrival for NZ passport which would definitely stock Warfarin or coumadin strong . I have an entry visa for Russia if need be if I hypothetically have to go to Moscow... but I'd rather not...

{"answer": "I'm in Russia now just got off the train in Volgograd. I know only a few words and am travelling on my own. Fair warning Russia my second visit is the hardest country I've travelled in. I struggle with the Cyrillic but it's definitely worth learning. It gets faster to read quite quickly. One of the best suggestions is to write requests down. For example trains I write the destination in Cyrillic the time numbers are mostly universal and the class and draw a set of bunks to indicate the top bunk. Almost no words are required but it's clear what I'm after. It's hard but I arrived with fewer than 10 words and I've certainly managed entering from Finland I went to Murmansk down to St Petersburg across to Moscow and back and now down to Volgograd. It's a fantastic country well worth it but it IS hard ", "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 0, "downModVotes": 0, "score": "16", "upModVotes": 16}, "author_metadata": {"id": "30", "username": "victoriah"}, "id": 174, "question": {"subtitle": "Or alternatively how well spoken and widely spoken is English?

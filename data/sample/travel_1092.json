I need a pair that keeps water out and that I can wear both when hiking and through cities so I don't need to carry another pair . I'm not looking for a specific brand although some examples would be welcome but rather how do I test whether it's waterproof before I buy it how do I know it will be comfortable I hiked for a day with a pair I got from a friend they seemed comfortable at first but then it got really bad so bad that I lost a toenail after a few days ? And also what else should I look for besides waterproof and comfortable ?

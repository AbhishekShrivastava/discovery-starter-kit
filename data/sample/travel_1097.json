{"accepted": 0, "answer": "Bank of Internet USA a not to be confused with Bank of America offers a free checking account which comes with an ATM card with no withdrawal fees. They also refund other bank's fees up to some small amount. I used their card in several countries in East Asia and Europe with no major problems. The only downside is that they will start charging a 1 currency exchange fee starting September 2011 currently this is zero as well . Typically major U.S. banks charge huge em fees some hidden e.g. Chase ATMs charge 5 fixed 1 fee 3 hidden exchange fee in addition to destination bank charges of course . Avoiding destination bank ATM fees overt and hidden is also significant. If you have a specific destination in mind try researching specific ATMs with low or no fees for foreign transactions.

This was nice because there was less traffic so we were able to move around better. At the same time it was really quite hot which was not as fun. I'm definitely not a fan of crowds but I would rather deal with crowds than with bad weather and less activities. What are the ideal times of the year to visit France particularly Paris balancing out weather crowds locals and tourists and available activities festivals and such ?

When we arrived there no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's but at a 7 15 fee which was not really a very fun surprise. While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks it seems that they were not really accepted the usual explanation being fraud . So the question is is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?

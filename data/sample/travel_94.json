{"answer": "I normally do some research before going there e.g. googling best things to do in x or looking at travel sites and forums reading a good guide or if you are lucky asking some friends who have been there. That would be able to give you an idea. Once I am abroad I simply talk to people and ask to everyone either local touristic info hotel personel restaurants bars personel taxi drivers etc... or tourists who may have been there for a few days before me and can tell me what they liked or disliked.

I do enjoy guided tours on some occassions but I'm more interested in finding cool local markets restaurants historical sites photography opportunities or nearby nature walks hikes that are hidden gems. For example when in Sydney a relative pointed us to a small nature reserve one of hundreds or thousands when simply looking at a map that turned out to be a deep beautiful forest in the middle of a neighborhood. Before a trip I usually search online for reviews of things to do but mostly I just come up with tourist traps. So how do I find the opposite of tourist traps once I'm actually on site?

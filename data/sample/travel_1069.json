{"accepted": 1, "answer": "The tourist information offices in Ireland here's a list from the Irish Tourist Organisation 'Discover Ireland' a sell booklets with maps of campsites. I got one in the Dublin office for 5. It lists loads of campsites has some photographs of them lists details opening days phone numbers directions facilities etc. . They also sell booklets of B amp B's Hotels. That has an overview map but wouldn't count as a street atlas. As far as I know most road atlases which can be bought almost anywhere in many bookshops and newsagents around the country will mark campsites they won't have the level of detail like phone numbers so you can ring ahead and book or get directions that the one from the tourist information office will have so I recommend supplimenting your street atlas with this campsite directory. Are you camping or taking a caravan mobile home.

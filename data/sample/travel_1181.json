{"accepted": 0, "answer": "Most government health organizations recommend that chemoprophylaxis a when traveling to an area where malaria is endemic which includes South India . However you should do whatever makes you comfortable ideally after discussing it with a travel doctor. When I was in Delhi it was primarily during winter and my travel doctor told me that for that area at that time of year it really wasn't necessary for me to take anti malaria pills because there was virtually no risk of contracting malaria then. Malaria season is whenever there are mosquitos basically when it's warm hot and there is water around. Monsoon season is the highest risk time for malaria typically May October. I was in India from January May and only took Malarone for about less than half that time middle of March through the end of my trip in May . You should also discuss with a doctor with type em of anti malaria pills are best for you there are pros and cons for the convenience and side of effects of all the varieties available. The biggest difference convenience wise is taking a pill once a week is easier than doing it every day but many people have stronger adverse reactions to the weekly over the daily. Again discuss with your doctor what is right for you any travel clinic can help.

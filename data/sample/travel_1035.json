{"accepted": 0, "answer": "In my experience I've found quite a few travellers with guitars so it's fairly common. Most seemed to use some form of rocket atttached to the back but fuel for this is hard to come by in certain areas of the world and often requires FAA approval to use in the States. No seriously lots of people do and much like travelling with a snowboard it generally just goes into the oversize baggage area often at no extra cost to you. This is both domestic and international. But it's definitely important to check with your airline as everyone has different rules I'd hate to know what RyanAir would do to you if you tried with them ", "answerScore": "8", "authorUserId": "377", "authorUsername": "Jonathan Thomson", "downModVotes": 0, "id": 1035, "subtitle": "During my upcoming holiday to the USA I'm thinking about buying a new guitar as the exchange rate is extremely favorable. Excuse my naivety but I have never flown with a guitar before. What is a recommended way to go about this? Could I take it as carry on luggage or would it have to be checked? If checked luggage what kind of precautions should I take to keep it safe? Are there any problems with flying US budget carriers? If I do buy the guitar I'm expecting to have to make two flights with it one domestic flight with Virgin America and an international flight with Air NZ.

{"accepted": 0, "answer": "The answer depends on the number of people travelling with you and the age of the infant. If you have an extra seat for your infant you are required to bring your child seat that you use in your car on board. This results in even more baggage. Also you can only be sitting at certain rows since an additional oxygen mask is required.

{"accepted": 0, "answer": "Last night we had a story on Carte Blanche a South African investigative reporting program where they said that there are about 140 000 incidents of theft at OR Tambo per year so the situation is still really bad despite lots of measures put in place. They showed CCTV camera footage of how the thieves know exactly where the cameras are and grab bags off the conveyor belts in such a way that nothing can be seen in the cameras. The bottom line is just that you should never ever put anything valuable in your luggage if flying anywhere in SA just keep valuables in your hand luggage. Period. See the following link a about the mentioned show with interviews with the head of security and with the Police.

My question is how bad is the situation now. I noticed that many of these reports are older from around 2006 and that the airport authority started a campaign to resolve the problem. Has the situation improved in 2011?

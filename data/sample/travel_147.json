{"answer": "You need a bit more information. Are you going with a tour or solo? I went solo and I don't really know any Russian aside form what I picked up while there.

If you smile and point you should be fine. It really depends on how experienced you are at traveling. I do of course always recommend studying up on the culture and language A BIT before you go. Know some words and carry a dictionary. The 'Where is... bathroom police embassy ' and 'I want... food water beer ' set of words is pretty much required where ever you go.

{"accepted": 0, "answer": "This completely depends on the city and situation. I've only used a private car service once in Lima Peru as the taxi drivers are notorious for ripoffs and theft. When I arrived at the hostel I was staying at there were two people staying there who had all of their belongings stolen by their taxi driver at knifepoint. An Australian tourist was also recently shot by her taxi driver in Lima after refusing to hand over her belongings. In retrospect it seems like that was 20USD well spent but I wouldn't bother paying it in places that didn't have a reputation.

Are there any other advantages that a private car may have over a city taxi? Are there any other disadvantages other than the cost? Do city taxis have hidden costs that a traveler should be aware of such as running the meter while waiting for a rider ?

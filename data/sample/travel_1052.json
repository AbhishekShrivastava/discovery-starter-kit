{"accepted": 1, "answer": "The Association of Flight Attendants a cites three main risks they are attempting to mitigate with turning off and stowing personal electronic devices Devices flying around the cabin li Distracting from instructions li Electronic Interference li ol Follow instructions regarding Personal Electronic Devices If an emergency incident were to occur during a critical portion of your flight Portable Electronic Devices could fly around the cabin if not properly stowed distract passengers from hearing Flight Attendant instructions or generate electronic signals that interfere with critical aircraft instruments. blockquote While the Kindle may not use much power when the wireless is turned off it is NOT completely off however the operating system continues to run and RAM continues to be refreshed it can still fly around the cabin and serve as a distraction. According to these criteria a Kindle with the wireless off is no different from a laptop or phone in airplane mode and should therefore be treated the same.

Let's suppose I have a Kindle 3 and I have turned off wireless i.e. both Wifi and GSM 3G is off . Since you don't need power or the battery to read what's on the screen the magic of eInk displays it's technically 'off' when I'm reading it right? Can I still use it when the flight is taking off? Have any national aviation authorities passed judgement on this?

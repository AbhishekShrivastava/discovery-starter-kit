{"accepted": 0, "answer": "Just to be clear are you talking about a single ticket or buying two separate tickets? If you have a single ticket with an international segment followed by a domestic segment the airline will accommodate you on the next flight if the international procedures immigration customs etc. take too long and you miss your connecting domestic flight. Of course the next flight could be much later or full but you will get there eventually em . If you are buying separate tickets there is no guarantee at all that you can board the next flight if you miss your connection. In general I wouldn't try to schedule a very tight international connection but if your connecting domestic destination has frequent flights it may not be too risky.

Until now I have always entered the US at my destination. This is not always the cheapest option. I was told that 3 hours is the advised time to go through immigration and boarding of a connecting flight. Online booking sites still offer connecting flights with a transfer times sometimes even less then 1 hour.

{"answer": "December is summer time in Argentina. So I do not recommend you to try winter stuff . Buenos Aires is Argentina's capital. You must go to a Tango show some requires you to book in advance . You also must eat a typical barbecue if you are not vegetarian . I love everything they do with milk and also their wines are very good Malbec is the better grape . They have been considered as small Europe in South America and you should visit places like Caminito in Buenos Aires. You should also visit Patagonia maybe with a small boat trip to explore the views. You can also try the Andine Lakes between Argentina and Chile. In this case I recommend you to start in one country and return home by the other.

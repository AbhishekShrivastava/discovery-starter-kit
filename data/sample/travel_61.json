{"answer": "My experience is that a normal taxi is always cheaper. The only advantage of a private car service is that the cost is fixed unlike a taxi where the price on the meter if there is one can vary depending on the route how long it takes or how much the driver feels like charging. There is also the possibility of getting ripped off by a taxi driver. Also the private car services tend to have newer cars and in my experience the drivers can be a little less crazy . Finally I've found that in some cities that the only taxis that are possible to call by phone are private taxis and that regular taxis can only be hailed on the street.

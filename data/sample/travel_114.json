{"accepted": 1, "answer": "My personal experience has been that it's best to get a SIM card for each country I travel in. Local providers almost always have the best deals and buying SIM cards is relatively inexpensive. Especially in Asian countries where I have more travel experience you can easily pick up SIM cards at shopping kiosks almost anywhere and the rates are really very cheap compared to where I live New Zealand . Data roaming from international providers is also very expensive as an example with my New Zealand cellphone provider in China I would pay US25 a megabyte whereas buying a local SIM card it cost me US8 for 250 megabytes.

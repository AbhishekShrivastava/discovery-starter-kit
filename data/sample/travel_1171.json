They are open the same time as station is near all around clock with little interval at night and you can use as you want I've inserted all my luggage into one locker and saved some money for example . Luggage room is on underground level inside the station so you don't need to move much far away with your luggage.

Before I plan part of my day in Paris around it being available though I thought it was worth checking. Does anyone know if there is a left luggage facility available at Paris Gare du Nord station? Assuming so what kind is it? Is it like the one in Milan where there's a staffed left luggage counter on the station concourse and you need to be aware that it closes? Or is it like Brussels Midi where there are just a load of large lockers in racks? Hiding round the corner on the way to platforms 3 6 if you're looking for them Or perhaps even like Cologne Kln where there is a nifty underground robotic thingy where you can drop off or collect your bags from any of the locker like units? Oh and if there is one is it anywhere near the Eurostar platforms or am I looking at walking half way back to England to find it on the other side of the huge station...?

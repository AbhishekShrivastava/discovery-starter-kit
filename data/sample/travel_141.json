{"answer": "Answering my own question it looks like all flights currently go through larger Yemeni cities and traveling by boat is likely to be just as dangerous due to Somali pirates. From the Australian Government's Travel Advisories for Yemen There is a high risk of piracy in the coastal areas of Yemen. There have been attacks by pirates against all forms of shipping in and around Yemens waters and the Gulf of Aden. Pirates have been using motherships to attack shipping further than 1 000 nautical miles 1 850km from the coast of Somalia. All forms of shipping are attractive targets for Somali pirates including commercial vessels pleasure craft yachts etc and luxury cruise liners... maintain a high level of vigilance and to exercise extreme caution when anywhere near these waters. According to the International Maritime Bureaus IMB Piracy Reporting Centre PRC there were 217 attempted attacks of piracy with 47 vessels hijacked and 867 crewmembers taken hostage in the Gulf of Aden and off the east coast of Somalia in 2009.

If I'm merely looking at the destination and not the deals to be had how do I find out which tropical destination has the attributes that are most desirable to me? I need help even knowing what questions to ask but a few which come to mind are What is the hiking like nearby? What is the average wind speed like? What type of beaches are available surfing sunbathing secluded scenic What is the water like? Clear and calm strong swell covered with seaweed etc. Is the water good for swimming? Counter example we took a trip to Broome Western Australia and found out that basically one shouldn't swim at all during the time of year we were there due to jellyfish stinger threats And once I know what questions to ask about the destination what is the best method of finding a good match?

{"accepted": 1, "answer": "Just to see the view? An hour tops. At the top there's a revolving restaurant where the food is not bad although a bit on the expensive side... but the view and the experience are spectacular. It takes about an hour to do a full revolution and getting a table for the sunset hour is well worth the price of dinner on a fair weather summer evening. On the other hand you could spend all day right near the Space Needle. The Pacific Science Center and the Experience Music Project are both right there at Seattle Center. And take a walk over to the fountain outside the Key Arena too. Fabulous place to spend just an hour or make a whole afternoon evening of it.

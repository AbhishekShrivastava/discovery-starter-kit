{"answer": "My answer is Europe centric We are used to banks in the USA that will give you a debit or check card with a magnetic stripe. Credit cards are the same way. Some of these credit cards have a chip and almost none of them require a pin when used as a credit card. On the other hand when you fly sail swim across the pond to Europe almost every local card has a Chip and a Pin. Most European stores will accept US credit cards. I was able to buy food grocery etc. using my USA credit cards. Ticket vending machines for trains or buses other automated machines small merchants etc. will require the Chip and Pin. Lack of Chip and Pin what had me waiting in line to buy a ticket for 80 min at Gare du Nord in Paris and barely caught my train. Now defunct The Travelex Cash Passport which is chip and pin protected is a good idea but it costs a lot. If you load it in small increments they can charge you just about 14 . You can also open an overseas account but I have heard that such an account is usually considered a red flag for an IRS audit. Read this very enlightening thread started by Joel Spolsky.

When we arrived there no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's but at a 7 15 fee which was not really a very fun surprise. While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks it seems that they were not really accepted the usual explanation being fraud . So the question is is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?

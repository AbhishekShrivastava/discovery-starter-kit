{"accepted": 1, "answer": "If you can't get it on the plane you'll need to contact a freight forwarder. Check your local phone book. It's probably not going to be cheap expect to pay several times more per kilogram than you would for excessive baggage on an airplane. Also since it is unaccompanied baggage you may have significant hassles and fees with customs. The freight forwarder should be able to advise you the details. Frankly I agree with Gagravar I don't think shipping CRT monitors like this makes any sense at all.

I understand this is a lot of weight and will take up a lot of space. In fact from a cursory perusal of airline baggage policies it doesn't look as though I will be able to check it. How can I get ten computers and myself from Portland Oregon to the Dominican Republic?

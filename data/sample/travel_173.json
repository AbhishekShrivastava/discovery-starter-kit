{"answer": "I've just been in Rovaniemi Finland a couple of weeks ago. It's currently impossible to see the aurora as the 24 hour day is in place obviously you need a dark sky to see it. However Rovaniemi is just by the Arctic circle is easy to get to fly or train from Helsinki overnight and is also the home of Santa Claus I stayed at the Borealis Guesthouse which should give you a clue as to what is visible from there Best times are when it's dark obviously so when there's a new moon is your best bet the least light in the sky. Check that first for dates. Secondly if you have the ability to book last minute you can sign up on twitter for Aurora storm alerts. However this is infeasible for most given flight costs and so on. Rovaniemi claims to see the auroras most nights although of course it's totally weather and solar activity dependent you can never guarantee it. ONE MORE option however does practically guarantee sightings. Kangerlussuaq in Greenland offers a 99 chance of seeing auroras between November and March due to its very stable weather conditions. It's where I'm planning on going next year.

I'm currently thinking of February up at Sweden's ice hotel but since the whole point of the trip is so that my wife can see the Aurora I want to pick a location that affords the best chances to see one. Edit Just adding a link so you can see realtime aurora activity in the northern hemisphere http www.gi.alaska.edu AuroraForecast 3 I know this is anecdotal but I ended up going to Iceland in late february during the new moon and saw the aurora 3 out of 6 nights I was there. There was activity every single night but the biggest problem was weather. It was cloudy almost every single night.

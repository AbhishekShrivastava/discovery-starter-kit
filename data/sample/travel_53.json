{"answer": "You don't mention what kind of trips you like but if you like nature I would highly recommend Patagonia specifically El Calafate and Ushuaia. December is a good season to go. Distances inn Argentina are large even if you're not going all the way to Patagonia. Bus service is excellent with luxury buses reclining seats and meal service. Plane flights are also available but can be expensive. I would only recommend a rental car for local trips once you've reached your final destination.

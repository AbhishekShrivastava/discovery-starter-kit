{"answer": "In December at least it will be summer so you can explore the entire country Suggested cities and activities below El Calafate Patagonia use as a base to go see the Perito Moreno glacier the 3rd largest in the world and the general area great for hiking climbing and trekking. The Andes are spectacular down there. Ushuia the end of the world it's where the boats go to Antarctica if you've got the cash it's not cheap Iguazu Falls these spectacular falls are about 275 individual falls on the border between Argentina and Brazil. You CANNOT miss these. Buenos Aires the home of Tango you must see a show. I suggest Cafe Tortoni on Avenida de Mayo it's cheaper than the touristy meal dinner lesson ads you see everywhere and is the oldest Tango hall in the city. Fantastic show Recoleta cemetery is interesting and La Boca district and see a football match if at all possible Puerto Madryn Wildlife bonanza where you can watch whales from your hostel balcony swim with seals one of only 3 places in the world and see many more animals on the Valdez peninsula we saw seals sea lions elephant seals whales guanacoes rheas mara armadillo foxes a penguin and more Mendoza a wonderful place in western Argentina it's wine country I could retire there tomorrow. It has great weather still enjoys a siesta has some of the best wine in the world and the steak restaurants were fantastic as was the ice cream As for getting around bus is the easiest safest and most comfortable. Three major classes semi cama chairs that tilt cama turns to bed and cama suite unbelievable. Generally includes food ham and cheese in semi cama it goes up to champagne and roasts in cama suite and quality depends a bit on company but most in Argentina are fantastically comfortable even for long distances. I really would recommend AGAINST renting a car. The distances are so vast better to just let the public transport take you there. Perhaps you might rent one in El Calafate to go see some of the places around there but there are cheap tours to the glaciers and so on anyway it's really not necessary.

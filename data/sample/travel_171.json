{"answer": "Jozza'a quote above is on so many of the 'crazy' travellers' Facebook profiles that I encounter. I'm in southern Russia at present after a 34 hour train journey and I'm trying to work out how to get into Kazakhstan. I don't speak the language don't know where I'm going and am on my own. And you know what? I haven't had any problems no crime the train runs fine exactly to time and in general people are friendly and helpful even if you can't understand each other. A friend cycled from London to New Zealand over 20 months. She was on her own cycling through places like Iran Afghanistan India all 'hard' countries some very scary. Again she was fine. She had some scares sure but in general she made it through with amazing stories. My personal quote is that as long as you survive a bad experience it makes a great story and adds to your character. Another friend who I'm currently chasing is in Uzbekistan. He's riding a 85cc scooter from London to Mongolia. He's crashed broken down lost parts and people have welded his scooter together for nothing hunted out spare parts for him and always refused to take money they're happy to help out of the goodness of their hearts. It's something you start to realise every country has some crime some bad people. But if you're careful in GENERAL people everywhere are basically good and happy to help a fellow human being. Don't be scared be cautious. It's a fantastic world out there it's scary but it's exciting.

It probably will be fine if we stay in the main town area but some interesting places to visits are really creepy when viewed from TV. Some dangerous activities will include hiking diving or camping. So when thinking of visiting or doing them there is always fear of anything might happen such as kidnapping getting lost hostile citizens villagers crimes shark attack jelly fish attack accidents and so on. Therefore I only will visit places that is already proven really safe and convenient. I really want to do it sometimes. Any suggestion to fight the fear? ", "title": "Hodophobia ...
